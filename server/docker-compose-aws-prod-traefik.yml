# This compose file requires that you have two files located at ~/ of the host machine:
# traefik.toml and acme.json
# traefik.toml should be the same file as found in this project.
# acme.json should be a blank file with the permission code 600.
# And by host machine, that means that if this is being use on a docker-machine such as an EC2
# instance, yes, those files must be on THAT instance.
#
# cd to ./server/traefik
# Use the script init.sh to upload the traefik.toml and a blank acme.json to the server.
#   sh init.sh api.metric-teacher.com
# Use download.sh to back it up (it'll save to acme.json.bak):
#   sh download.sh api.metric-teacher.com
# DON'T COMMIT acme.json or acme.json.bak and keep it safe!
# If you want to re-upload traefik.toml or have an acme.json file you wanna upload, run:
#   sh upload.sh api.metric-teacher.com
