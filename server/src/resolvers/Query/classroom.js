  TODO Query/classroom.js notes
  Make it so that querying classrooms only gets students whose course is currently active.
  Basically, if a student switches courses, they will no longer exist.
  Additionally, perhaps create an alternative query where it DOES show these inactive course
  students so that if there is a case where a teacher is wondering why one of their students
  suddenly went missing (in the future where courses are assignable. For now I'm just concerned
  about a single enrollment and a single course, this is all future-proofing) there should be a way
  to discover them! Either that addition will be "here's everyone, even the inactive students"
  or "here's just the inactive students".
