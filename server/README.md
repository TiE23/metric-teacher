# üìêüóÑüóÇüó≥üìè metric-teacher Server üìèüó≥üóÇüóÑüìê
This is the documentation for the server side of the metric-teacher project, a Node.js GraphQL API software project.

This is a project conceived and implemented completely by myself, Kyle Geib. UW Bothell educated, Seattle located SDET turned Product Support Engineer turning to eventual JavaScript Full-Stack Developer. I've been a professional programmer since 2013-01-02.

It is written with...
* Prisma - [github.com/prismagraphql/prisma](https://github.com/prismagraphql/prisma)
    * GraphQL-YogaÔ∏è - [github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-yoga)
    * Prisma-Binding - [github.com/prismagraphql/prisma-binding](https://github.com/prismagraphql/prisma-binding)
* dcodeIO's bcrypt.js - [github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js)
* auth0's node-jsonwebtoken - [github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)
* Facebook's Jest - [jestjs.io](http://jestjs.io/)

    * linear-presets - [github.com/javiercejudo/linear-presets](https://github.com/javiercejudo/linear-presets)
* Lodash - [lodash.com](https://lodash.com/)

It uses [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/) for its Database, [**Prisma**](https://www.prisma.io/) for its GraphQL Database, and [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) + [**Docker-Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) to build and run the virtual machines for these programs.

It is written against **Node.js v10.5.0**, though it does not use any bleeding-edge JavaScript.

I wrote it using the following tools:
* JetBrain's WebStorm IDE - [jetbrains.com/webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
* Prisma's GraphQL Playground IDE - [github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground)
* Sublime HQ's Sublime Text 3 Text Editor - [sublimetext.com/3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* syntevo's SmartGit Git Client - [syntevo.com/smartgit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/)

*First commit made on 2018-05-07 but an idea in my head since mid-2015.*

## dotenv
There is a secret file that is not in this repo: `.env`
(to be explicit, it's located at `./server/.env`)

This file has a few things that need to be kept secret (hint, they're the ones with "secret" in the name):
```
PRISMA_STAGE="dev"
PRISMA_ENDPOINT="http://self:4466/server/dev"
PRISMA_CLUSTER="local"
PRISMA_SECRET="SOME_PRISMA_SECRET"
APP_SECRET="SOME_APP_SECRET"
PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET="SOME_PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET"
```

You start the Prisma + MySQL DB docker containers by using `docker-compose` (install Docker locally on your machine) and running `docker-compose -f ./database/docker-compose.yml up -d`. It's intentional that you run the program from this directory, `./server`, so that the `.env` file can be read by `docker-compose` automatically.
You kick-off the Prisma server by using the command `prisma deploy` if you've installed the prisma module globally (with `npm i -g prisma`), otherwise `yarn prisma deploy`/`npm run prisma deploy` should work.

The three secret keys should be random strings of characters and digits and symbols. I used random [`UUID4`](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)s for mine.

`PRISMA_SECRET` is the secret key for the Prisma server (a local Docker container). If you change this secret you'll need to re-deploy the Prisma server. From there you can use `prisma token` to grab a new token if needed. This token is used when using the Playground when you add to the HTTP header like this:
```
{
  "Authorization" : "Bearer <token>"
}
```

`APP_SECRET` is used by the login system for the server. It is used as the secret key to the [`JWT token`](https://jwt.io/) signing process in `src/utils.js`. If you change this secret all users will have to log in again.

Finally, `PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET` was added in Prisma 1.7 that provides an easier and cleaner password system between your host computer and the Prisma server (it replaces a traditional SSH key). It is defined and used in `~/.prisma/config.yml`, for example:
```
clusters:
  local:
    host: 'http://localhost:4466'
    clusterSecret: "SOME_PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET"
```

Both `docker-compose` and `prisma deploy` read this secret. `docker-compose` feeds it in while launching the container, and `prisma deploy` uses it to gain access.

You *need to create this file* before things can run. You can even copy the example I have above if you want.

This file is used by the module [`dotenv`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

If you ever do remote hosting, you'll need to change the endpoint's url to the remote host's location, and change the `PRISMA_CLUSTER` value to whatever additional cluster you define in `~/.prisma/config.yml` (like the above example for `local`). You should do this by defining a second `.env` file with a name like `.env.remote` and then run, for example, `prisma deploy -e /.env.remote`.

## GraphQL API Documentation
### Types
#### User
For public-ish use. It does not expose password, email, enrollment, or classroomsTeaching. It does, however, expose first and last names. So take note about ever making this truly public.
```
type User {
   id: ID!
   createdAt: DateTime!
   updatedAt: DateTime!
   honorific: String
   fname: String!
   lname: String!
   type: Int!
   status: Int!
   flags: Int!
 }
```

#### PrivateUser
For private use. It does not expose password.
```
type PrivateUser {
  id: ID!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  email: String!
  honorific: String
  fname: String!
  lname: String!
  type: Int!
  status: Int!
  flags: Int!
  enrollment: Enrollment
  classroomsTeaching: [Classroom!]!
  feedbackWritten: [Feedback!]!
  feedbackReviewed: [Feedback!]!
  questionsWritten: [Question!]!
  questionsReviewed: [Question!]!
}
```

#### QaObject
This is a complexly structured type with many nested types in order to recreate the deeply nested structure of a QA JSON object.
```
type QaObject {
  questionId: ID!
  subSubjectId: ID!
  difficulty: Int!
  flags: Int!
  media: String
  question: QaQuestionObject {
              detail: String!
              text: String!
              type: Int!

* `user(userid: ID!): PrivateUser`
    * Get the PrivateUser data of a user account. Only the owning user (or moderators or better) can do this. This essentially becomes a me() query providing far greater simplicity for client logic allowing shared code between self data and other user data.
* `users(userids: [ID!]!): [PrivateUser]!`
    * Get the PrivateUser data of multiple user accounts by their ID. For moderators and better only.

    * Get a list of Surveys by Prisma query search parameters. For moderators or better only because of potentially sensitive data. Students can get through other options.

#### Question Queries
* `question(questionid: ID!): Question`
    * Get a Question by ID. For teachers and better only.
* `questions(questionids: [ID!]!): [Question]!`
    * Get a list of Questions by a list of IDs. For teachers and better only.
* `questionSearch(where: QuestionWhereInput, orderBy: QuestionOrderByInput, skip: Int, after: String, before: String, first: Int, last: Int): [Question]!`
    * Get a list of Questions by Prisma query search parameters. For teachers and better only.
* `checkSubmitQuestion(type: Int!, questioninput: QuestionQuestionInput!, answerinput: QuestionAnswerInput!): Boolean!`
    * Provide a quick dry-run of submitQuestion. It'll throw up a bunch of errors if something is wrong, otherwise it'll return true. If this returns true, the question will be accepted.

### Mutations
#### Auth Mutations
* `signup(email: String!, password: String!, fname: String!, lname: String!): AuthPayload!`
    * Sign up for an account. All arguments are required and emails need to be unique.
* `login(email: String!, password: String!): AuthPayload!`
    * Log in to the account of a user by providing the email and password. Bcrypt is used to check the password input for correctness.

#### User Mutations
* `updateUserProfile(userid: ID!, email: String, password: String, honorific: String, fname: String, lname: String): PrivateUser!`
    * Mutation providing a method to self-update user profile information. There are some additional checks on Moderators disallowing them from updating other Moderators or Admins. Admins, on the other hand, have full power.
* `updateUserStates(userid: ID!, type: Int, status: Int, flags: Int): PrivateUser!`
    * Mutation providing administrative-style updates to a User row. This includes changing the type, status, and flags of a User. There are some additional checks on Moderators disallowing them from updating other Moderators or Admins. Admins, on the other hand, have full power.

#### Student Mutations
* `enrollStudent(studentid: ID!): Enrollment!`
    * Gives a student a new Enrollment and immediately gives them a new Course and sets it as active.
* `assignStudentNewCourse(studentid: ID!, prefermetric: Boolean): Course!`
    * Give a student a new Course. They must be enrolled first, though.
* `setActiveCourse(studentid: ID!, courseid: ID!): Course!`
    * Will set a student's Courses all to inactive and the targeted Course to active. Requires the studentid to perform.

#### Course Mutations
* `assignStudentNewMasteries(student: ID!, subsubjectids: [ID!]!): Course!`
    * Assigns subSubjects to a student's active Course. If at all possible prefer assignCourseNewMasteries() over this function as it involves an extra hit to the database to get the student's active Course. Only the owning student (or moderators or better) can do this.
* `deactivateCourse(courseid: ID!): Course!`
    * Deactivates a course. Only the owning student (or moderators or better) can do this.
* `addMasteryScores(studentid: ID!, scoreinput: [MasteryScoreInput!]!): Course!`
    * Give a student ID and a list of combination SubSubject IDs and scores (positive or negative) and those values will be added to each valid Mastery belonging to that student's active Course. It automatically gathers the Mastery IDs so you don't need to! Only the owning student (or moderators or better) can do this.

    Rarity is determined by this algorithm:
        * _Every subSubject gets 100 chances to be picked in for the next question. The rarity number reduces those chances. All the chances of all possible subSubjects for a challenge are added together and a random number between 1 and that cumulative value is picked. If the number picked falls on one of those "chances" the subSubject is picked._

## Logic Documentation
### Question/Answer format
Because questions and answers can be a little more nuanced than something simple like "What is freezing temperature in Celsius?" with the answer "0", I had to define a special string formatting language so I could express complex questions and answers into single strings.

*Units*
* Metric (regular)
    * `m` - meter
    * `kg` - kilogram
    * `l` - liter
    * `c` - Celsius
    * `kmph` - kilometers per hour
    * `sqm` - square meter
* Metric (irregular)
    * `ha` - hectare (area), 1 to 10,000 square meters
    * `sqkm` - square kilometer (area), 1 to 100 hectares
* Imperial (regular)
    * `ft` - foot
    * `lb` - pound
    * `gal` - gallon
    * `f` - Fahrenheit
    * `mph` - miles per hour
    * `sqft` - square foot
* Imperial (irregular)
    * `in` - inch, 12 per 1 foot
    * `oz` - ounces (mass), 16 per 1 pound
    * `floz` - ounces (volume), 128 per 1 gallon
    * `acre` - acre (area), 1 to 43,560 square feet
    * `sqmi` - square mile (area), 1 to 640 acres

*Multiple Choice Syntax*
* Multiple Choice Question
    * `What is length of 1 foot in centimeters?` (nothing special, write the question. Just do not use square brackets.)
* Multiple Choice Answer
    * `[#UNIT|#UNIT|#UNIT|#UNIT]` (simple, first choice is the correct one and order is randomized)
    * `[#UNIT|#UNIT|#UNIT|#UNIT|#UNIT]4` (first choice is the correct one and only up to 4 options will be displayed at once)

*Range Syntax*
Auto generated range questions will always ask a question like the following:
"Convert 1.80 meters to feet (within 0.5 feet accuracy)."
If you add some text, it will appear like so:
"Convert 1.80 meters to feet (within 0.5 feet accuracy). This is a typical height of an adult man."

* Text before range syntax
    * `This is a common room temperature. [#,#UNIT(#)s]` (simple, with a written sentence for syntax. Space optional.)
* Range Question (Conversion or Survey)
    * `[#,#UNIT(1)s]` (simple, with whole numbers)
    * `[#,#UNIT(0.1)s]` (with steps of 0.1)
    * `[#,#UNIT(10)s]` (with steps of 10)
    * `[#,#UNIT]` (no steps defined, defaults to 1)
* Range Answer (Conversion or Survey)
    * `[UNIT(1)a]` (simple, with whole numbers)
    * `[UNIT(0.5)a]` (accept an answer within 0.5 units accuracy)
    * `[UNIT(3)a]` (accept an answer within 3 units accuracy)
    * `[UNIT(0)a]` (accept only an exact answer)
    * `[UNIT]` (no accuracy defined, defaults to 1)

Examples:
* Q: `[5,10m(1)s]` A: `[ft(1)a]`
    * Would ask to convert a random whole number of meters between 5 and 10 (inclusive) and demand a conversion in feet accurate to within 1 foot.
* Q: `[18,22c(0.5)s]` A: `[f(2)a]`
    * Would ask to convert a random temperature between 18 and 22 Celsius in 0.5 increments and demand a conversion in Fahrenheit accurate to within 2 degrees.
* Q: `Starting at what height would you describe an adult man to be 'very tall'? [72,79in]` A: `[cm(3)a]` User's Survey Answer: `75in`
    * This question accepts a range between 72 to 79 inches (about 1.82 to 2.00m). A survey has four different phases:
        1) It starts by asking the user's opinion (that's when it gets the 75 inch answer).
        2) It asks the user to re-identify their answer from multiple choices. The wrong answers will be generated by randomly displaying +/- 1-4 times the step value `(#)s`. In this case, it might generate the following answers: 75in (correct), +1in (76in), -3in (72in), +3 (78in).
        3) When the user has confirmed their estimate enough times (after hitting a certain threshold tracked through the survey's score field) the survey question will instead ask the person to answer the question in metric with their Imperial answer displayed. Multiple choices will be generated in the same manner as the second phase, simply converted to the Metric value
        4) Finally the same exact case as phase 3 but without showing the user's Imperial answer. (May consider randomly showing or not showing the Imperial answer. Perhaps let the user click on a "your answer is hidden" span that'll show it with perhaps only a small score/mastery penalty).
