Metric-Teacher.com is a WebApp designed to teach Americans the Metric System (and, similarly, Metric users the US Customary System) in a Duolingo-like way.

### Technology
Metric-Teacher.com is a full-stack JavaScript website utilizing React, Semantic UI, GraphQL, MySQL, and hosted (normally) with AWS EC2 instances using Docker and Traefik.

While Meti is resting his wings, take a look around the GitHub project where the source code is hosted publicly on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/TiE23/metric-teacher) for anyone to view and learn from.

### Credits
Metric-Teacher.com is the passion project of Seattle-based software development engineer Kyle Geib. It got him a contract job at Facebook in 2019, pretty sweet, huh? He can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-m-geib/), [GitHub](https://github.com/TiE23), and [Flickr](https://flickr.com/kg-23).
